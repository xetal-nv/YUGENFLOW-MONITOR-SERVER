[sensors]
; declaration of individual sensors are optional (MAC without :)
; if not defined the server will use the id provided by the sensor and ignore any ID=65535
; mac : id attribute attribute {attribute}
; The id must be an integer and at least one attribute must be specified.
; The attribute can be one of the following strings:
;  bypass : ignore the id value the device sends with the data
;  report : report if the sensor uses a different id
;  enforce : force the device id to the given value (has no effect with strict)
;  strict : if the device id is not as the declared id, the sensor is ignored (overridden by bypass)
0a0b0c010201   : 1 bypass
0a0b0c010203   : 3 bypass

[gates]
; name : {!}sensor_id {{!}sensor_id}
; a ! before a sensor_id indicated a reversed sensor
kit0                : 0 2
kit1                : 1 !3
; set the following property to true to save data to the database
save : false

[entries]
; name : {!}gate_name {{!}gate_name} ...
; a ! before a gate name indicated that the gate is reversed
kitchen0             : !kit0 kit1
