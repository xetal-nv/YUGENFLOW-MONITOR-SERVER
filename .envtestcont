cls##### SERVER SETUP #####
## ADDRESSES
## HTTPSPORTS = app port, api port ## If the ports are the same, one server only will be activates
HTTPSPORTS = 8080
TCPPORT = 3333

##### Defines edition type #####
EDITION = contagt

##### GATE AND GROUPS #####

## GATE ORIENTATION
##REVERSE = id_gate ...

## STRICT MODE ##
## If set, it does allow to connect only devices whose mac
## has been declared in the configuration file
MACSTRICT = 0

## SPARE DEVICES ##
## Declares unused devices that are allowed to connect but currently not used
## It is required in strict mode
#SPARES = mac1 mac2 ...
#SPARES = 0a:1c:74:66:66:67 0a:1c:74:66:66:68

## GATE COMPOSITION
## Gates are defined by at least one devices, number has to be crescent without gaps
## Device order follows from the first device to the last while entering
## IMPORTANT: Devices CANNOT be shared among gates and server DOES NOT SET the device ID
#GATE_number = device_id device_id ...
#GATE_number = device_mac?device_id device_id ...
#GATE_0 = 66:66:66:66:66:67?1 0
GATE_0 = 0 1


## ENTRY COMPOSITION
## An Entry is a groups of gates defining the entry into a space, number has to increase from 0
## IMPORTANT: Gates CANNOT be shared among entries
##ENTRY_id = gate_id gate_id ...
ENTRY_0 = 0


## SPACES DECLARATIONS
## Define the region where gates are to be combined in terms of name and maximum occuopancy (optional)
## IMPORTANT: Entries CANNOT be shared among spaces
## NOTE: names longer than LENLABEL characters will be truncated in the database
## NOTE: names shorter than LENLABEL characters will be extended with '_'
##SPACES_NAMES = name_space:max_occupancy ...
SPACES_NAMES = door1

## SPACE COMPOSITION
## Lists the entry points per space
##SPACE_x = id_entry  id_entry ...
SPACE_door1 = 0

##### AVERAGE ANALYSIS #####
## DESCRIPTION: provides average number of people and flow, also in real time

## MULTICYCLE DAYS ONLY
## If not null, forces analysis longer than one day to be rounded to an integer number of days
MULTICYCLEDAYSONLY = 1

## ANALYSIS WINDOW
## Defines the period in which analysis will be executed (24h format hh:mm)
##ANALYSISWINDOW = start end
#ANALYSISWINDOW = 08:40 18:30

## CLOSURE DECLARATION
## Define the time when the space is assumed always empty, 
## n this periods the space counter are always reset
##CLOSURE_x = start as xx:xx; end as xx:xx
CLOSURE_door1 = 3:00; 05:00

## ANALYSIS DEFINITION
## Defines a given storage interval in seconds.
## Intervals shorter than a day will be used fully for calculating the averages with data received in ANALYSISWINDOW
## For intervals longer than a day, the duration of ANALYSISWINDOW will be considered per day average only
## NOTE: analysis 'current' is reserved
## NOTE: do not use values below SAMWINDOW for the shortest interval, values greater then 20s are advised
## NOTE: names longer than LENLABEL characters will be truncated in the database
##ANALYSISPERIOD = name seconds; name seconds; ...-
ANALYSISPERIOD = 20secs 20; 20mins 1200;hour 3600; day 86000

##### PRESENCE DETECTION #####
## DESCRIPTION: This detection provides the number of possible detection in a given interval
## It does not provide real-time data.

## PRESENCE INTERVAL DEFINITION
## Defines internals of time where only presence detection is relevant, no counting
## Time is provided in the HH:MM format
##PRESENCE_spacename = detector name start end; ...
PRESENCE_door1 = morning 08:00 12:30; afternoon 13:00 18:00; night 18:00 06:00


##### REPORTING #####

## RT VALIDITY WINDOW
## Defines the period in which real-time reporting will be provided (24h format hh:mm)
## Note this setting overrides ANALYSISWINDOW for the JS.
## It is best practice that RTWINDOW is included in ANALYSISWINDOWs
##RTWINDOW = start end
RTWINDOW = 08:00 23:00

## RT ANALYSIS ##
## Specifies which analysis will be shown in the real-time panel
##RTSHOW = name name ...
#RTSHOW = 20secs 20mins hour day

## REPORTED ANALYSIS ##
## Specifies which analysis will be shown in the reporting panel
##REPSHOW = name name ...
#REPSHOW = 20secs 20mins hour day

## ENABLING AND DEFINITION IF THE OVERVIEW REPORT ## (being developed and defined)
## Day definition for the overview report, time format hh:mm
## OVERVIEWREPORT =  start end
#OVERVIEWREPORT = 08:00 19:00

## Defines the report structure. Three type of data are available
## 'presence' provides of there was activity in the given interval based on a given presence definition from PRESENCE_
## 'point' provides the average count at the moment in time with a given precision in minutes
## 'period' provides the average count int he given period
## The declaration order will be reflected in the reported order as well
##OVERVIEWDATA = ({presence start end name_measurement} | {point time precision} | {period start end}); ...
#OVERVIEWDATA = presence 18:00 06:00 night; period 08:00 12:00; point 10:00 30; presence 08:00 12:30 morning; period 13:00 17:00; point 14:00 30; presence 13:00 18:00 afternoon;

## Provide the average measurement, defined with ANALYSISPERIOD, to be used for calculations
## REFERENCESAMPLES = name_measurement
#REFERENCESAMPLES = 20secs

## SKIPDAYS = list week days to be skipped (0 is sunday, 6 is Saturday)
#SKIPDAYS = 0 6
#SKIPDAYS =
