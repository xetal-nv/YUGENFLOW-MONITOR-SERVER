**2.2 INFO**  
The INFO API return information about the installation as provided in the configuration.ini including possible run-time modifications.  
It returns a JSON ARRAY of the following format:  

    [
      {
        "spacename": "h0",
        "entries": [
          {
            "entryName": "e0",
            "gates": [
              {
                "gateName": "kit0",
                "devices": [
                  {
                    "deviceId": 0,
                    "reversed": false,
                    "suspected": false,
                    "disabled": false
                  },
                  ...
                ],
                "reversed": false
              }
            ],
            "reversed": false
          },
          ...
        ]
      },
      ...
    ]
    
It is am array of JSON elements each describing a defined space as a name and a list of entries.  

    "spacename": "h0",
    "entries": [
        ...
    ]

Each entry is described with a name, a list of gates and a flag indicating if the gate is mounted reversed. 

    "entryName": "e0",
    "gates": [
      {
        ...
    ],
    "reversed": false

Each gate us described with a name, a list of devices and a flag indicating if the gate is mounted reversed. 

    "gateName": "kit0",
    "devices": [
      ...
    ],
    "reversed": false
    
Each device is described with its ID, a flag indicating if it is reversed, a flag indicating if the device is suspected to be broken or malicious, and a flag indicating if the device has been disabled.    
                  
    {
    "deviceId": 0,
    "reversed": false,
    "suspected": false,
    "disabled": false
    },
      
**2.3 CONNECTED**  
The CONNECTED API return a JSON ARRAY containing data about all connected devices. Each device is described by means of its mac address (without : symbol) and a flag indicating of the sensor is active (sending data) or not.  

    [
      {
        "mac": "0a0b0c010201",
        "active": true
      },
      ...
    ]
    
**2.4 INVALID**  
The INVALID API return a JSON ARRAY containing data about all connected invalid devices. Each device is described by means of its mac address (without : symbol) and a the timestamp (unix Epoch format) when it was marked as invalid.  

    [
      {
        "mac": "0a0b0c010201",
        "timestamp": 12345678
      },
      ...
    ]
    
**2.5 MEASUREMENT**  
The MEASUREMENT API return a JSON ARRAY describing all defined measurements.  
Each measurement is given by means of its name, its type and the predicity in seconds.  

    [
      {
        "name": "ten",
        "type": "realtime",
        "interval": 10
      },
      ...
      {
        "name": "twenty",
        "type": "reference",
        "interval": 20
      }
    ]

The type can be 'realtime' when the measurement is done as a sliding window of 'period' seconds, or 'reference' and the measurement is taken periodically every 'perdiod' seconds.  
    
**2.6 LATEST**  
The LATEST API return a JSON ARRAY containing data of all latest measurement for all spaces (if no space is indicated) or for a given list of spaces.  
The JSON array is as follows:  

    [
      {
        "space": "h0",
        "type": "reference",
        "measurements": {
          'name_measurement': [data],
          ...
        }
      },
      ...
    ]

The field space is the space name and the type can be of value 'realtime' or 'reference' as defined in section 2.3.  
The results are given in the 'measurements' list, where each element is named according to the measurement name and
it is associated to an array of measurement data. This data is expressed as follows:  

    "twenty": [
    {
      "qualifier": "twenty",
      "space": "h0",
      "timestamp": 1605712842,
      "value": 0,
      "flows": {
            ...
      }
    },
    ]
    
In this example the measurement name is 'twenty' referring to a measurement of this name as provided in the measurement.ini file. 
In a real situation thje name will depend on what the user has provided at installation time.   
The array of data contains for this API only one value (the latest one), where 'qualifier' is the measurement name (it can be also empty), 'space' is the space name (it can be also empty),
'timestamp' is the timestamp expressed as Unix Epoch time and 'value' is the measurement value.  
Furthermore, the measurement provides the a list with all flows reported by each entry belonging to the space.  
Each element of this list is as follows:  

    "e1": {
      "id": "e1",
      "Ts": 1605712842503580600,
      "netflow": 1,
      "reversed": false,
      "flows": {
        "kit1": {
          "id": "kit1",
          "netflow": 1
        }
      }
    }
    
It has a field of name equal to the entry name (as form configuration.ini) and as value a JSON with field 'id' repeting the entry name, 'Ts' the measurement timestamp in Unix Epoch format, 
'netflow' that is the current difference in in- and outflow measured by the entry and 'flows' that provdes a list of flows from all gates composing the entry.  
Per gate a field is included in such list of name equal to the gate name (as form configuration.ini) and values 'id' (the gate name) and 'netflow' (the different between
in- and out-flow measured by the gate).   

**2.7 REFERENCE**  
The REFERENCE API reference returns  a number of results for one or more spaces according to how it is called.  
It answers with a JSON identicaly to the one described in section 2.4 except that the 'type' field is always equal to 'reference' and multiple measurement data are given in the data array:  

    [
      {
        "space": "h0",
        "type": "reference",
        "measurements": {
          "twenty": [
            ...,
            ...
          ],
          ...
        }
      },
      ...
    ]

**2.8 SERIES/REFERENCE**  
Like for the 'REFERENCE' API the SERIES/REFERENC API return several measurement data and specifically the data for one or more spaces in the given time interval with reference times expressed in Epoch Unix format.  
The JSON is identical as the one described in section 2.5.  

**2.9 PRESENCE**  
The PRESENCE API is used to check if thgere was somebody in a given space in the given time internal. Start and end times must be expressed in Epoch Unix format.  
The answer is a JSON array including data for one or more spaces and expressed as follows:  

    [
      {
        "space": "h0",
        "presence": false
      },
      ...
    ]

Where 'space' is the space name and 'presence' is true of there was a person in the space in the given interval, otherwise it is false.  

**2.10 COMMAND**  
The COMMAND API is used to manipulate the state and configuration of a device which is connected and valid in the system.  
For security reasons, devices that are invalid cannot be subjects of commands via this API.  
The API requires upto four argument:  

 - a comamnd 'cd' which is part of the API path  
 - a device identifier 'id'  
 - the mac of the device 'mac'  
 - a value to be apssed to the command 'val'
 
When already properly configured a device can be specified by 'id' or 'mac', otherwise only by 'mac'.  
Optionally the command can be executed asynchronously by setting the 'async' field to 0 or synchronously. It is highly advised to use asynchronous execution to avoid possible system slow down.  
Using of commands might severily impact system operation, thus it is advised only for advance users. The following commands are available:  

    list                    : return an array listing of all available command. Please note that the command is useful also for manual API usage as the answer is not a valid JSON response.  
    srate id|mac val        : sets the device sampling rate  
    savg id|mac val         : sets the sampling average  
    bgth id|mac val         : sets the background threshold  
    occth id|mac val        : sets occupancy threshold  
    rstbg id|mac            : resets thermal background  
    readdiff id|mac         : read difference counter  
    resetdiff id|mac        : reset difference counter  
    readinc id|mac          : read inflow counter  
    rstinc id|mac           : reset inflow counter  
    readoutc id|mac         : read outflow counter  
    rstoutc id|mac          : reset outflow counter  
    readid mac              : read device 'id'  
    setid id val            : set device 'id'  

The answer the API provides follows this JSON format:  

    {
        "answer" : "1735"
        "error" : ""
    }
    
In case of error the 'error' field is not empty, otherwise the answer of the device is transparently p;aced by the server in the fiels 'answer'.  

## 3. External scripting    
The server support external scripting triggered by new in- or out-flow data caming from individual gates. This option needs to be enabled at server launch with option '-export'
and it can be configured bie the access.ini.  
The script can be any command which can be executed from the root path of the server and can be specified(in the access.ini) as a 'command' and an 'argument'. The server 
will then execute the line 'command argument {JSONDATA}' every time there is a new data from any of the active devices. Please note that 'argument' can be empty as the convention supports both 
executables (e.g. command.exe JSONDATA) as pure scripting (e.g. python example.py JSONDATA).  
The command can be executed asynchronously, the server does not wait for the command to return a result, or synchronously, the server wait for the command to return a result. 
In synchronous mode anything non null returned by the command is considered error and reported as such in the log file.  
The JSONDATA field is a JSON string where 'actual' data is passed (see measurement.ini file for explanation of data types). The JSON format is as follows:

    {'qualifier':'actual','space':'h0','timestamp':1605772874,'value':2,'flows':{'e0':{'id':'e0','Ts':1605772874158902200,
    'netflow':-1,'reversed':false,'flows':{'kit0':{'id':'kit0','netflow':-1}}},'e1':{'id':'e1','Ts':16057728
    70146409600,'netflow':0,'reversed':false,'flows':{'kit1':{'id':'kit1','netflow':0}}}}}


that is equivalent to the JSON message:  

    {
      "qualifier": "actual",
      "space": "h0",
      "timestamp": 1605772864,
      "value": 2,
      "flows": {
        "e0": {
          "id": "e0",
          "Ts": 1605772864149408500,
          "netflow": 1,
          "reversed": false,
          "flows": {
            "kit0": {
              "id": "kit0",
              "netflow": 1
            }
          }
        },
        "e1": {
          "id": "e1",
          "Ts": 0,
          "netflow": 0,
          "reversed": false,
          "flows": {}
        }
      }
    }
    
Where:
 
 - 'qualifier' specifies the data type and can be 'actual' or 'reference' (see measurement.ini for data type explanation)  
 - 'space' is the space name  
 - 'timestamp' is the sampling time in Epoch Unix format  
 - 'value' is the count value  
 - 'flows' is the flow data per entry and respective devices which format is the same as the equivalent field in the JSON produced by the LATEST API  
 
Please refer to the language documentation on how to transform the JSON string into a JSON struct value in the external command/script.
In Python3 this can be achieved by means of a code such as:  
    
    jsonData = json.loads(sys.argv[1].replace("'", '"'))
    

## 4. Logs  
The logs file are contained in the './log' folder which is created by the server (if not already present).  
These files are to be used when cpomunicating with support in case of problems.  
The logs are a multi-file aggregating level log files that split information according to the relative microservice and provide information about type in a condensed matter.  
For further information refer to https://github.com/fpessolano/mlogger
