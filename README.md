Copyright Xetal @ 2020  
Version: 2.0.0  
Built: 20000a20210125  

**THIS VERSION BREAKS BACK COMPATIBILITY**  

**1.1 REQUIREMENTS**  
GO 1.15 or newer  
Golang Packages (to be revised):
 - go.etcd.io/bbolt/  
 - xetal.ddns.net/supportservices  
 - github.com/mongodb/mongo  
 - github.com/fpessolano/mlogger  (>=0.2.1)  
 - github.com/gorilla/mux  
 - gopkg.in/ini.v1  
 
External services:
  - mongoDB database (for full server only)  
  
Detachable services:  
  - webService  


**1.2 SYSTEM VARIABLES:**  
YUGENFLOW : specifies the path to the executable and configuration files, when the OS cannot handle services running from a fixed location      

**1.3 CONFIGURATION:**  
The configuration uses several ini files as follows (refer to the ini itself for a detailed description):  

access.ini : it sets access to the server by configuring and enabling database, tcp connection, external scripting and alike  
configuration.ini : it sets the installation in terms of gates, entries and spaces  
gateserver.ini : it contains all settings of the server itself  
measurement.ini : it contains the definitions of all measurements the server needs to precompute and provide.  
cache.ini : it sets the working cache (mipsle binaries only).  

**1.4 COMMAND LINE OPTIONS:**  

    -db path                : set database path  
    -dc path                : set disk cache path, if set it will override the environment variable for the cache    
    -delogs                 : delete all logs  
    -eeprom                 : enables refresh of device eeprom at every connection   
    -export                 : enable export mode  
    -fth int                : set failure threshold in severe mode (default 3)   
    -la                     : data API are disabled, only control API are active  
    -pwd password           : database password       
    -tdl int                : TCP read deadline in hours (default 24)   
    -st string              : set start time, time specified as HH:MM   
    -us                     : enable unsafe shutdown when initiated by the user (e.g. with CTRL-C), this can cause data loss and will prevent state save from working    
    -user username          : database username   

_For development and debug only:_    

    -debug                  : enable debug mode 
    -dev                    : development mode  
    -stress                 : number of stress cycles (overrides dev)
    -echo                   : server enables echo mode (0: off, 1: raw with not processing, 2: gate values, 3: space values)
    -la                     : not available    

**1.5 INSTALLATION**  
_Executable file_: gateserver(.exe) for complete server or gateserver_embedded(.exe) for sever without database.  
_Configuration files_: see 1.3 in the same folder as the executable.  
_Resource folders_: the folder log and tables are created by the server. Modifying them might cause the server to malfunction.

**1.6 BUILD OPTION**  
The following tags can be used for specific build:  

     - (notags)     : complete server build  
     - embedded     : build without database support  
     - debug        : build with debug support  
     - dev          : build with development and debug support  
     - script       : compiles only main_script for compilation of external scripts or other test code    
     - nc           : new cache (experimental)
 
Please refer to the nmake file for what compiler options are advicedc for which built.  
Note that mipsle/linux for OpwenWRT seems broken when some compiler flags are used.

**2.2 INFO**  
The INFO API return information about the installation as provided in the configuration.ini including possible run-time modifications.  
It returns a JSON ARRAY of the following format:  

    [
      {
        "spacename": "h0",
        "entries": [
          {
            "entryName": "e0",
            "gates": [
              {
                "gateName": "kit0",
                "devices": [
                  {
                    "deviceId": 0,
                    "reversed": false,
                    "suspected": false,
                    "disabled": false
                  },
                  ...
                ],
                "reversed": false
              }
            ],
            "reversed": false
          },
          ...
        ]
      },
      ...
    ]
    
It is an array of JSON elements each describing a defined space as a name and a list of entries.  

    "spacename": "h0",
    "entries": [
        ...
    ]

Each entry is described with a name, a list of gates and a flag indicating if the gate is mounted reversed. 

    "entryName": "e0",
    "gates": [
      {
        ...
    ],
    "reversed": false

Each gate us described with a name, a list of devices and a flag indicating if the gate is mounted reversed. 

    "gateName": "kit0",
    "devices": [
      ...
    ],
    "reversed": false
    
Each device is described with its ID, a flag indicating if it is reversed, a flag indicating if the device is suspected to be broken or malicious, and a flag indicating if the device has been disabled.    
                  
    {
    "deviceId": 0,
    "reversed": false,
    "suspected": false,
    "disabled": false
    },
      
**2.3 CONNECTED**  
The CONNECTED API return a JSON ARRAY containing data about all connected devices. Each device is described by means of 
its _mac_ address (without : symbol), it _id_ and the _active_ flag indicating of the sensor is active (sending data) or not.  

    [
      {
        "mac": "0a0b0c010201",
        "id": 1,
        "active": true
      },
      ...
    ]
    
When a device _id_ is not known it is indicated as -1.  
    
**2.4 INVALID**  
The INVALID API return a JSON ARRAY containing data about all connected invalid devices. Each device is described by means of its mac address (without : symbol) and a the timestamp (unix Epoch format) when it was marked as invalid.  

    [
      {
        "mac": "0a0b0c010201",
        "timestamp": 1605712842503580600
      },
      ...
    ]
    
**2.5 MEASUREMENT**  
The MEASUREMENT API return a JSON ARRAY describing all defined measurements.  
Each measurement is given by means of its name, its type and the period in seconds.  

    [
      {
        "name": "ten",
        "type": "realtime",
        "interval": 10
      },
      ...
      {
        "name": "twenty",
        "type": "reference",
        "interval": 20
      }
    ]

The type can be 'realtime' when the measurement is done as a sliding window of 'period' seconds, or 'reference' and the measurement is taken periodically every 'period' seconds.  
    
**2.6 LATEST**  
The LATEST API return a JSON ARRAY containing data of all latest measurement for all spaces (if no space is indicated) or for a given list of spaces.  
The JSON array is as follows:  

    [
      {
        "space": "h0",
        "type": "reference",
        "measurements": {
          'name_measurement': [data],
          ...
        }
      },
      ...
    ]

The field space is the space name and the type can be of value 'realtime' or 'reference' as defined in section 2.5.  
The results are given in the 'measurements' list, where each element is named according to the measurement name and
it is associated to an array of measurement data. This data is expressed as follows:  

    "twenty": [
    {
      "qualifier": "twenty",
      "space": "h0",
      "timestamp": 1605712842503580600,
      "value": 0,
      "flows": {
            ...
      }
    },
    ]
    
In this example the measurement name is 'twenty' referring to a measurement of this name as provided in the measurement.ini file. 
In a real situation the name will depend on what the user has provided at installation time.   
The array of data contains for this API only one value (the latest one), where 'qualifier' is the measurement name (it can be also empty), 'space' is the space name (it can be also empty),
'timestamp' is the timestamp expressed as Unix Epoch time and 'value' is the measurement value.  
Furthermore, the measurement provides the a list with all flows reported by each entry belonging to the space.  
Each element of this list is as follows:  

    "e1": {
      "id": "e1",
      "Ts": 1605712842503580600,
      "variation": 1,
      "reversed": false,
      "flows": {
        "kit1": {
          "id": "kit1",
          "variation": 1
        },
        ...
      }
    }
    
It has a field of name equal to the entry name (as form configuration.ini) and as value a JSON with field 'id' repeating the entry name, 'Ts' the measurement timestamp in Unix Epoch format (nanoseconds), 
'variation' that is the variation in the in- and outflow measured by the entry (in the observation window) and 'flows' that provides a list of flows from all gates composing the entry.  
Per gate a field is included in such list of name equal to the gate name (as form configuration.ini) and values 'id' (the gate name) and 'variation' (the different between
in- and out-flow measured by the gate in the observation window).   

When enabled in the _measurement.ini_ file, the data can also be of type "current". This is real time instantaneous data including also accumulating in and out flows for each element.  
This data is expressed by a single JSON array element composed as follows:  
    
    {
      "qualifier": "current",
      "space": "h0",
      "timestamp": 1606919957009922100,
      "count": 0,
      "in": 0,
      "out": 0,
      "resetTime": :1606919957009922100,
      "overflowTs": 0,
      "flows": {
        "e0": {
          "id": "e0",
          "Ts": :1606919957009922100,
          "netflow": 0,
          "overflowTs": 0,
          "in": 0,
          "out": 0,
          "flows": {
            "kit0": {
              "id": "kit0",
              "netflow": 0,
              "overflowTs": 0,
              "in": 0,
              "out": 0
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    
Where:
 
 - 'qualifier' specifies the data type and can be 'current' or 'reference' (see measurement.ini for data type explanation)  
 - 'space' is the space name  
 - 'timestamp' is the sampling time in Epoch Unix format (ns)  
 - 'count' is the value of the latest count  
 - 'in' and 'out' are the calculated in and out flows taken starting at time 'startTimeFlows' (in Epoch Unix format, ns)  
 - 'overflowTs' indicates when (in Epoch Unix format, ns) the in/out flow counter have overflow (64-but integer values)  
 - 'resetTime' indicate when the actual in/out floes have been reset. This is either server initial start or reset time as defined in the file configuration.ini. If 0, the data is not valid or empty.  
 - 'flows' is the flow data per entry and respective devices which format is the same as the equivalent field as the ones just described  
 
**2.7 REFERENCE**  
The REFERENCE API reference returns  a number of results for one or more spaces according to how it is called.  
It answers with a JSON identical to the one described in section 2.4 except that the 'type' field is always equal to 'reference' and multiple measurement data are given in the data array:  

    [
      {
        "space": "h0",
        "type": "reference",
        "measurements": {
          "twenty": [
            ...,
            ...
          ],
          ...
        }
      },
      ...
    ]

**2.8 SERIES/REFERENCE**  
Like for the 'REFERENCE' API the SERIES/REFERENCE API return several measurement data and specifically the data for one or more spaces in the given time interval with reference times expressed in Epoch Unix format.  
The JSON is identical as the one described in section 2.5.  

**2.9 PRESENCE**  
The PRESENCE API is used to check if there was somebody in a given space in the given time internal. Start and end times must be expressed in Epoch Unix format.  
The answer is a JSON array including data for one or more spaces and expressed as follows:  

    [
      {
        "space": "h0",
        "presence": false
      },
      ...
    ]

Where 'space' is the space name and 'presence' is true of there was a person in the space in the given interval, otherwise it is false.  

**2.10 COMMAND**  
The COMMAND API is used to manipulate **the state and configuration of a device** which is connected and valid in the system.  
For security reasons, devices that are invalid cannot be subjects of commands via this API.  
The API requires upto four argument:  

 - a command 'cd' which is part of the API path  
 - a device identifier 'id'  
 - the mac of the device 'mac'  
 - a value to be passed to the command 'val'
 
When already properly configured a device can be specified by 'id' or 'mac', otherwise only by 'mac'.  
Optionally the command can be executed asynchronously by setting the 'async' field to 0 or synchronously. It is highly advised to use asynchronous execution to avoid possible system slow down.  
Using of commands might severely impact system operation, thus it is advised only for advance users. The following commands are available:  

    list                    : return an array listing of all available command. Please note that the command is useful also for manual API usage as the answer is not a valid JSON response.  
    srate id|mac val        : sets the device sampling rate  
    savg id|mac val         : sets the sampling average  
    bgth id|mac val         : sets the background threshold  
    occth id|mac val        : sets occupancy threshold  
    rstbg id|mac            : resets thermal background  
    readdiff id|mac         : read difference counter  
    resetdiff id|mac        : reset difference counter  
    readinc id|mac          : read inflow counter  
    rstinc id|mac           : reset inflow counter  
    readoutc id|mac         : read outflow counter  
    rstoutc id|mac          : reset outflow counter  
    readid mac              : read device 'id'  
    setid id val            : set device 'id'  

The answer the API provides follows this JSON format:  

    {
        "answer" : "1735"
        "error" : ""
    }
    
In case of error the 'error' field is not empty, otherwise the answer of the device is transparently placed by the server in the field 'answer'.  

**2.11 DEVICEDEFINITIONS**  
The DEVICEDEFINITIONS API is used to read, delete and add sensor definitions. The operations are defined as follows:  

***2.11.1 readall command***

    /devicedefinitions?cmd=readall

The command _readall_ will return all current definitions. The answer of the command is as follows:

    {
    "definitions": [
      {
        "mac": "50:02:91:d5:f2:f6",
        "id": 0,
        "sampleMaximumRateNS": 0,
        "bypass": true,
        "report": false,
        "enforce": false,
        "strict": false
      },
      ...
    ],
    "error": ""
    }
  
Where definitions is an array of definitions providing as data the mac address (_mac_), the id (_id_), the maximum sampling rate 
(_sampleMaximumRateNS_) in ns and its behavioral flags (_bypass, report, enforce, strict_).  

***2.11.2 read command***

    /devicedefinitions?cmd=read&mac=xyz

The command _read_ reads the definition (if present) for the device with mac _xyz_. Mac is accepted with and without ':'.  
The command answer follows the same format as the _readall_ command except the definition array has only one element.  

***2.11.3 delete command***

    /devicedefinitions?cmd=delete&mac=xyz

The command _delete_ removes the definition (if present) for the device with mac _xyz_. Mac is accepted with and without ':'  
The command answer follows the same format as the _readall_ command except the definition array is empty and only the eventual error is reported.  

***2.11.4 add command***

    /devicedefinitions?cmd=add&mac=xyz&id=i{&params=bypass|report|enforce|strict}

The command _add_ add the definition for a device with mac _xyz_ and id _i_ and parameters _params_.  
Please note that parameters given are set according to priority. Bypass has priority on strict and strict on enforce.  
Mac is accepted with and without ':'.   
The command answer follows the same format as the _readall_ command except the definition array is empty and only the eventual error is reported.  

***2.11.5 save command***

    /devicedefinitions?cmd=save

The command _save_ saves the configuration in a new _configuration.ini_ file (the current one is renamed with a timestamp).  
The command answer follows the same format as the _readall_ command except the definition array is empty and only the eventual error is reported.  


**2.12 DISCONNECT**  
The DISCONNECT API is used to disconnect a device from the server given. The api is used as follows:  

    /disconnect?max=xyz
    
Where _yxz_ is the mac of the device to eb disconnected. The answer is of format:

    {
        "answer" : ""
        "error" : "failed"
    }
    
With _answer_ always empty and _error_ not empty in case of errors.


## 3. External scripting    
The server support external scripting triggered by new in- or out-flow data generated by individual gates. This option needs to be enabled at server launch with option '-export' and it can be configured in the access.ini file.  
The script can be any command which can be executed from the root path of the server and can be specified(in the access.ini) as a 'command' and an 'argument'. The server 
will then execute the line 'command argument {JSONDATA}' every time there is a new data from any of the active devices. Please note that 'argument' can be empty as the convention supports both 
executables (e.g. command.exe JSONDATA) as pure scripting (e.g. python example.py JSONDATA).  
The command can be executed asynchronously, the server does not wait for the command to return a result, or synchronously, the server wait for the command to return a result. 
In synchronous mode anything _non null_ returned by the command is considered error and reported as such in the log file.  
Scripting supports only 'current' and 'reference' data (see measurements.ini for their definition). For 'current' data the JSON format is as follows:  

    {"qualifier":"current","space":"h0","timestamp"::1606919957009922100,"count":0,"in":0,"out":0,"startTimeFlows"::1606919957009922100,
    "overflowTs":0,"flows":{"e0":{"id":"e0","Ts"::1606919957009922100,"netflow":0,"overflowTs":0,"in":0,"out":0,"flows":
    {"kit0":{"id":"kit0","netflow":0,"overflowTs":0,"in":0,"out":0}}}}}


That is equivalent to a JSON message in the same format as described in section 2.6.   
For how to extract and use this JSON string, please refer to the files example.xyz as example for language xyz.    


## 4. Logs  
The logs file are contained in the './log' folder which is created by the server (if not already present).  
These files are to be used when contacting with support in case of problems.  
The logs are a multi-file aggregating level log files that split information according to the relative microservice and provide information about type in a condensed matter.
