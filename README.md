**TO BE FULLY REDONE, VERSION BREAKS BACK COMPATIBILITY**

**REQUIREMENTS**  
GO 1.14 or newer  
64-bit architecture  
Golang Packages (to be revised):
 - go.etcd.io/bbolt/  
 - xetal.ddns.net/supportservices  
 - github.com/mongodb/mongo  
 - github.com/fpessolano/mlogger  (>=0.2.1)  
 - github.com/gorilla/mux  
 - gopkg.in/ini.v1  
 
External data:  
  - tbd
  
External services:
  - tbd  

**API:(TBD)**  
/asys -> information on all current analyses  
/info -> installation information  
/pending -> list all devices pending for connection approval (only current connections)    
/active -> list all valid connected devices  
/und -> list all connected devices that are not used in the installation  
/udef -> list all devices with undefined id 0xff that have been connected  
/udef/active -> list all connected devices with initial id 0xff  
/udef/notactive -> list all not connected devices with initial id 0xff  
/udef/defined -> list all defined devices with initial id 0xff  
/udef/undefined -> list all not yet defined devices with initial id 0xff  
/x/y/z -> actual value for data x in space y on averaging z  
/series?last=x?type=y?space=z?analysis=y -> last x samples of type y from space z and analysis y  
/series?type=y?space=z?analysis=y?start=x0?end=x1 -> samples of type y from space z and analysis y from timestamp x0 to timestamp x1  
/presence?space=z?analysis=y?start=x0?end=x1 -> samples of type presence from space z and analysis y from timestamp x0 to timestamp x1, the value is set to 2 when activity is detected in the period and the value is equal to the number of detection at the end of the period  
/command?cmd=x?id=y?mac=w?val=z -> execute command x on sensor y or w with data (if necessary) z when z is an array. If both y and w are specified it returns error    
/command?cmd=macid?id=y?val=z -> assigns the id y to device with mac z of the device has currently id 0xff, mac must be passed given as a sequence if hex values like 1a:62:63:ef:32:36  
/command?cmd=list -> lists all available commands  
/command?pin=xyz -> sends debug pin xyz, answer true is accepted, nothing otherwise  
/dbs/retrieve/samples -> retrieve sample data from .recoverysamples if dbsupdate is set   
/dbs/retrieve/presence -> retrieve sample data from .recoverypresence if dbsupdate is set   

  
NOTE: values in val are specified as x,y,n,..   
NOTE: series API supports types: sample, entry (debug mode only). Data for the current day are only available in debug mode
