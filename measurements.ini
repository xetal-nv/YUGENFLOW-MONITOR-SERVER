; measurements are divided in three tpes.
;
; 'realtime' measurements are defines as a sliding windows (in seconds) and they calculate the flow in such a sliding window.
; for example specifying 5 means that the measure will give the average value for the last 5 seconds
;
; 'reference' measurement are specifying with a repetition interval.
; for example specifying 5s means that we will csalculate a new averag every 5s.
;
; 'actual' data is the real time as generated without any averaging performed.
; this data is available for scripting and is provided via the API also is enabled.
