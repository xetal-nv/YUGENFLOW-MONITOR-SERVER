; measurements are classified in three types.
;
; 'realtime' measurements are defines as a sliding windows (in seconds) and they calculate the average count and flow
; in such sliding window. For example, specifying 5 means that the measure will give the average value for the last 5 seconds
; as count and the flows in the last 5 seconds
;
; 'reference' measurement are specifying with a repetition interval.
; For example, specifying 5s means that we will calculate a new average and flows every 5s.
;
; 'current' data is the real time as generated without any averaging performed and uit includes also accumulated in/out flows.
; this data is available both via scripting and via the API (must be enabled, see below).
