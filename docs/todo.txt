Overall code cleaning
Give JS analysis specs for proper reporting and simplify code
Entry split in and out (only day basis so that net flow stays 0, but first check if we cannot align entries ...)
log binary (command line) dump data per day
Graphs for current day
No current disables only report (only with graphs)
