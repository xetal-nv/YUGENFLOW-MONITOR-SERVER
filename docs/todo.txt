Overall code cleaning
Give JS analysis specs for proper reporting and simplify code
Add API: pin code to enable debug mode (time based, use ip table)
Entry split in and out v0.8 (ony day basis so that net flow stays 0)
log binary (command line) dump data per day
add graphs as reporting instead of number
Remove entry from API user
Simplify debug gui (forced values)
Graphs for current day
Overview report remove last day (add warning on report)
