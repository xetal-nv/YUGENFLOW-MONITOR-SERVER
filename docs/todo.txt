Target 1.0.0:
Overall code cleaning
Make command line interface to the database for debug
Entry split in and out (only day basis so that net flow stays 0, but first check if we cannot align entries ...)
configurable report
realistic sensor model (for demo usage)
move html to git module (see how)
make js sampling depending on smallest measurement and samwindow for dbs.
