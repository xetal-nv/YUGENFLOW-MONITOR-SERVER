##### PRESENCE DETECTION #####
## DESCRIPTION: This detection provides the number of possible detection in a given interval

##### REPORTING #####

## Defines the report structure. Three type of data are available
## 'presence' provides of there was activity in the given interval based on a given presence defintion from PRESENCE_
## 'point' provides the arevage count at the moment in time with a given precision in minutes
## 'period' provides the average count int he given period
## The declaration order will be reflected in the reported order as well
##OVERVIEWDATA = ({presence start end name_measurement} | {point time precision} | {period start end}); ...
